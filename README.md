<h2>--Answer Key--</h2>
1. entering the username and password into Instagram will bring you to the Instagram account of Mackenzie's missing sister, Dakota
<br>
<br>
2. after looking into Dakota's chat history, we find a link to a fake art website called Paintnook
<br>
<br>
3. we don't know the email and password used by Dakota, so we answered the security question instead. after investigating her Instagram account more, we find the answer

<br>
4. two clues are hidden in the Paintnook welcome video: morse code hinting for you to turn up screen brightness and the link to Creepy Page Login

5. the chat page contains the past chatlogs between Dakota and her kidnapper. if you try to send a message, the kidnapper will respond with a warning
<br>
<br>
6. the account page contains Dakota's past posts and it has a gif of eyes again at the bottom. When you turn up the brightness, you will find Morse code for a password fragment to the Creepy Page Login
Creepy Page Login

<br>
7. the bottom ad of the homepage brings you to a fake error page, which contains another Morse code password fragment. 
<br>
<br>
8. when you come back from the error page, the entire Paintnook layout is messed up with broken divs and gifs of eyes everywhere
<br>
<br>
9. if you look into chat logs again after coming back from the error page, you will find the last morse code password fragment in one of the kidnapper's messages
<br>
<br>
10. inputting all 3 password fragments (677401) in number form into the Creepy Page Login, it will grant you access
<br>
